In February 2020 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-51646254) on new official figures on rough sleeping that suggested a 9% fall in those counted or estimated on the streets on a single night.

While charities welcomed the apparent decline, there are concerns that counting on a “given night” in autumn does not show the full scale of rough sleeping across England. 

[Figures obtained by the data unit and published a day earlier](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/homelessness-real-figure) suggested 25,000 rough sleepers encountered in one year by three quarters of councils.
